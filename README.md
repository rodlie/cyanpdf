# Cyan PDF

![Logo](docs/logo.svg)

A simple tool designed to convert any PDF into a prepress-ready CMYK PDF/X document, ensuring your print projects are ready for professional-quality printing with accurate colors and reliable output.

Our goal is to produce identical output to what you get from professional design applications. We do this by using [Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com), an interpreter for PostScriptÂ® and PDF.

This project was created to solve a personal need: replicating the CMYK output of Affinity Designer/Publisher on a Linux system without the use of Scribus.

Therefore, the project will initially be feature-light and exclusively target Linux users in source form, as we will not be distributing pre-compiled binaries.

Output has been verified to be identical to Affinity Designer/Publisher (v1.10 macOS) using CMYK and PDF/X with ISO Coated.
