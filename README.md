![Logo](docs/logo.svg)

A simple tool designed to convert any PDF into a prepress-ready PDF/X document, ensuring your print projects are ready for professional-quality printing with accurate colors and reliable output.

This project was created to solve a personal need: replicating the CMYK output of Affinity Designer/Publisher on a Linux system without the use of Scribus.

Therefore, the project will (initially) be feature-light and exclusively target Linux users in source form.

Output has been verified to be identical to Affinity Designer/Publisher (v1.10 on macOS) using CMYK and PDF/X with ISO Coated v2.
